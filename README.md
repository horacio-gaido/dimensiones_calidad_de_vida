## Introduction

### English

Pursuing happiness is a **fundamental objective** and last of most human beings.



Relevant questions are asked about the configuration of the lifestyle, habits and behaviors of individuals. The following dimensions are explored: body, mind, experience, connection, meaning, compassion, generosity, and how much you are 'living your dream life'.

This work can identify what factors a particular person can improve to increase their quality of life and observe what the situation of people in a group is, in order to analyze behaviors.

### Español
La **felicidad** es un tema de mucho interés por nuestra sociedad desde antes de la época de Sócrates, el trabajo es una actividad diaria que realiza la mayoría de las personas en el mundo, algo en lo que dedicamos la mayoría de nuestro tiempo en la vida laboral entre los 18 y 70 años en la actualidad y el equilibrio entre ambas es muy importante para vivir una vida saludable y feliz. 

Perseguir la felicidad es un **objetivo fundamental** y último de la mayoría de los seres humanos.
Usando el conjunto de datos obtenido de una encuesta que recopila 15.972 respuestas realizadas voluntariamente por personas, se buscar obtener información relevante que permita mejorar el balance entre la vida de una persona y su trabajo. 

Se hacen preguntas relevantes, sobre la configuración del estilo de vida, hábitos y comportamientos de los individuos. Se analizan las siguientes dimensiones: cuerpo, mente, experiencia, conexión, significado, compasión, generosidad y cuánto 'está viviendo la vida de sus sueños'. 

Este trabajo puede identificar qué factores puede mejorar una persona en particular para aumentar su calidad de vida y observar cual es la situación de las personas en forma grupal, para poder analizar comportamientos.


## Methodology

Using the data set obtained from a survey that collects 15,972 responses made voluntarily by people, the aim is to obtain relevant information that allows improving the balance between a person's life and their work.


We then used Jupyter Notebooks to analyze data from surveys, to explore the relationships between these dimensions and other variables that may influence quality of life.

## Results

According to authentic-happiness.com , the score for balance between work and personal life is the total of five categories: a low score is below 550, a good score is above 680, and an excellent score is above 700. The average score from the analyzed surveys is 667 points, with a standard deviation of 45 points. The minimum score is 480 and the maximum is 820 points. The first quartile is 636, the second quartile is 668, and the third quartile is 698 points.

Research shows that people who do what they are passionate about tend to achieve more personal and professional success. However, for most people, there is no correlation between their passion and the number of hours they dedicate to work to make ends meet.

On average, people sleep for 7.04 hours per night, with a standard deviation of 1.20 hours. Interestingly, 68% of the surveyed population sleeps for the necessary amount of hours for their age, while only 2% sleeps for 10 hours. However, the remaining 30% of people sleep less than 7 hours, which can be extremely detrimental to their health and overall quality of life.

## Conclusion

The quality of life we experience depends on the behaviors we have in different dimensions of our lives, which are affected by many variables that change in different life stages. Individual habits and actions greatly influence perceived quality of life. There are numerous internal and external factors, both controllable and uncontrollable, that affect our quality of life. Our birthplace also plays a role in this regard, as it can determine the contextual factors influencing our quality of life. This work presents a macro and generalized view of the behaviors in different dimensions of our lives, identifying factors that affect quality of life to varying degrees, some of which are more easily changeable than others. 

Making small changes can produce significant improvements in our quality of life. Although many people do not meditate regularly, it has been shown to have many health benefits and the time spent meditating is a good investment. The number of hours we sleep each day and our level of physical activity are also key variables that affect our quality of life. Consuming fruits and vegetables and maintaining close social connections with family and friends can also lead to a better quality of life, as it promotes reduced stress levels and greater social engagement outside of our immediate circle.
